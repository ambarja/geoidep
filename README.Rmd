The goal of geoidep is to offers R users an easy and accessible way to obtain official cartographic data on various topics, such as society, transport, environment, agriculture, catastre, climate, among others.
It also includes information provided by regional government entities and technical-scientific institutions,
managed by the Spatial Data Infrastructure of Peru (IDEP).

## Installation

You can install the development version of geoidep like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(geoidep)
dep <- get_departaments(show_progress = FALSE)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r dep}
head(dep)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
